# Abstract

This is a collection of notes on various topics. All notes are written in markdown format, usually called "README.md".
There is a github page in this project, which is used to show the content of the notes. Users can search the content
with the specific key word. For example, if you want to search the content of "git", you can type "git" in the search
bar.
After getting desired result, you can find the project repository according to the name of folder. Then you can start
your own development and implementation quickly and efficiently.

# Introduction

In my personal experience, I have found that knowledge in my brain are no longer to exist after a very period of time.
Therefore, I have decided to write down all the knowledge in a new repository named "book". Forgetting some important
information is
a painful experience, because you need to spend extra time to do researches and studies. As a
result,
a new documentation system is required to collect all notes in your brain or computer. For small project, I will put
down the
folder
under "root" directly. For large project, I will create a new repository to store all the notes. But, you can still find
the link in the "Book List". In this way, I can
quickly find resources I need in the future.

If you are interested in the automatic booking system, you can visit my github page shown as above.
